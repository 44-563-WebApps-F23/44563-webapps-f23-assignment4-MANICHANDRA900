        <h1>Manichandra Kuntala acts in a play.</h1>
        <h2>An Enemy of the People.</h2>
        <h3>Author:Henrik Ibsen</h3>
        <p>SCENE: _DR. STOCKMANN'S sitting-room. The room is plainly but neatly appointed and furnished. </p>
            
           <h2>Mrs. Stockmann</h2><p> You see, if you come an hour late, Mr. Billing, you
            have to put up with cold meat.</p>
            
           <h2>Billing </h2><p>It is uncommonly good, thank you—remarkably good.</p>
            
            <h2>Mrs. Stockmann</h2><p>My husband makes such a point of having his meals.
            punctually, you know.</p>
            
            <h2>Billing</h2><p>That doesn't affect me a bit. Indeed, I almost think I enjoy a
            meal all the better when I can sit down and eat all by myself, and
            undisturbed.</p>
            
            <h2>Mrs. Stockmann</h2><p>Oh well, as long as you are enjoying it—. <p>(Turns to.
            the hall door, listening.) </p>I expect that is Mr. Hovstad coming too.</p>
            
            <h2>Billing</h2><p>Very likely.</p>
            
            <p>(PETER STOCKMANN comes in. He wears an overcoat and his official hat,
            and carries a stick.)</p>
            
            <h2>Peter Stockmann</h2><p>Good evening, Katherine.</p>
